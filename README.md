this is a small example of a movies website the main project in pro.js you can run it by writing node pro.js on the terminal and there are html files for the views.
I didn't upload the videos so if you run it locally you will not find trailers of movies, however I deployed it with heroku.
So you can see the website with the videos from this link https://ourgreatnetflix.herokuapp.com/
